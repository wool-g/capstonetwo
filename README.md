# Capstone Two

## Description

Through analyzing estimated ridership of the MTA subway system, I found that ridership since 2020 has been lower than typical pre-pandemic levels. To help find a solution to lack of faith in the system, I brought multiple datasets in from the MTA open data website, and determined the causes for delays and stress on the subway system.

Completion of this endevor helped to strengthen my skills working with python inside a jupyter notebook. I was able to utilize the pandas package to clean and understand the data and I employed seaborn, matplotlib to create visulizations to represnt my findings.
